## Overview

### The challenge
  - This was my first project replicating a design, creating a single-page recipe card.
  - Making the layout respond to different screen sizes was the main task.
  - Additionally, I had to ensure there was a specific amount of empty space around the main content container on a desktop screen.
  - It was a fun challenge to make the design look pixel-perfect.

## My process

### Built with
- HTML for the content and CSS for all the styling.
- I used media queries to handle the responsiveness.
- Mobile-first workflow.

### What I learned

- How to apply media queries to create a responsive layout and make the design look good on both mobile and desktop.
- How to layout the html using BEM css(Block, Element, Modifier).

### Continued development

- I plan to explore CSS Grid for more complex two-dimensional layouts.
- I will work on making the page more accessible for users with disabilities.
- I'd like to refactor my CSS to be more modular and scalable.

### Useful resources

- MDN Web Docs and W3Schools are my go-to resources for quick references.
